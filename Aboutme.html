	I have been working as a tester for over a year and have a bachelor's degree in Electronics and nanoelectronics and a master's degree in Computer technology. I work as the QA Team Lead of the Product Testing Department team in the Russian branch of OPPO, one of the largest consumer electronics manufacturer in the world, and I am responsible for test process of all smartphones that are sold on the territory of Russia. I am in charge of planning the testing strategy of current projects, monitoring the testing process and checking the quality of the tests performed by QA Engineers. It is also my responsibility to communicate and resolve issues with partners, operators, team leaders from other regions and company developers. I take part in interviewing new testers and follow the process of training new team members according to my plan for training new employees. Also, every few months I organize visits to exhibitions, online webinars and testing to improve the qualification of QA Engineers.
